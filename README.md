There are many portfolio website templates available on Github, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this one. A simple, easy to configure, lightweight, and responsive static portfolio website.

I know one template doesn't fulfill everyone's needs. So I'll try adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

**Features**

- [x] Easy to configure
- [x] SEO friendly
- [x] Responsive
- [x] Lightweight
- [x] Linktree Page

**Built with** [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) & [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com).
